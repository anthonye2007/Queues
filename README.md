DevOps HW 4
=====

## Setup
* Ensure nodejs, npm, and forever are installed and on the path
* Clone, then run `npm install`
* Install multiple instances of redis (Mine run on 6378 and 6379)
* Run `node main.js`

## Progress
* I implemented blue/green git hooks for deploy
* Got multiple redis instances running but getting an error and couldn't figure out why

## HW 3 details
I worked with Justin Smith to complete the workshop assignment.
I completed set/get as well as recent, but nothing more.

Justin and I got this far in class together, and then he continued working on it from his repo.
Just noting that his submission will be more complete than mine.

Also, even though the commit log will only show that Justin made commits, we were pair programming in class and thus I didn't actually make the commits.
He can verify this if need be.
